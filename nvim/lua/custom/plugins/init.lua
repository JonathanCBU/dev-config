-- Custom plugins are organized in separate files in this directory
-- Each plugin has its own file for better organization and maintainability
-- Files in this directory are automatically loaded by lazy.nvim

-- You can add your own plugins here or create new files in this directory!
-- Each file should return a plugin spec (or a table of plugin specs)

-- This file is intentionally left minimal since we have plugins in separate files
